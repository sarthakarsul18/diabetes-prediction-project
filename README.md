# diabetes-prediction-project
This project predicts diabetes using machine learning on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It preprocesses data, tunes a RandomForestClassifier with GridSearchCV, and achieves 75% accuracy. Implemented in Python with pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib, it aims to improve accuracy through advanced features and algorithm.
